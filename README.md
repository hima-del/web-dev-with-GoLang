**What is concurrency**

* Concurrency is the capability to deal with lots of things at once.
* Let's consider a person jogging. 
* During his morning jog, lets say his shoe laces become untied. 
* Now the person stops running, ties his shoe laces and then starts running again. 
* This is a classic example of concurrency.
* The person is capable of handling both running and tying shoe laces, that is the person is able to deal with lots of things at once

**What is parallelism and how is it different from concurrency?**

* Parallelism is doing lots of things at the same time.
* lets assume that the person is jogging and also listening to music in his iPod.
* In this case the person is jogging and listening to music at the same time, that is he is doing lots of things at the same time. 
* This is called parallelism.
